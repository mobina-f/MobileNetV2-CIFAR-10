Project Overview

This project implements an image classification model using the MobileNetV2 architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to accurately classify images into one of the 10 predefined categories, such as airplanes, ships, cats, and automobiles.

About MobileNetV2

MobileNetV2 is a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network architecture developed by Google for mobile and embedded vision applications. It builds upon the original MobileNet by introducing two key innovations: 
Inverted Residuals with Linear Bottlenecks: Instead of expanding the number of channels after convolution (as in traditional residual blocks), MobileNetV2 first expands the input channels, applies depthwise convolutions, and then projects them back to a lower-dimensional output using linear bottlenecks. This helps preserve features while reducing computation.
Depthwise Separable Convolutions: These convolutions factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution (which filters input channels separately) and a pointwise convolution (which combines them). This drastically reduces the number of parameters and computation without sacrificing much accuracy

About CIFAR-10 Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used benchmark in computer vision, especially for image classification tasks. It was created by the Canadian Institute For Advanced Research (CIFAR) and consists of:
60,000 color images, each of size 32Ã—32 pixels
10 classes, with 6,000 images per class
